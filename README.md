Window : 
To compile a Python script into an executable (.exe) on Windows, you can use PyInstaller. Here are the detailed steps:

1. Install PyInstaller

Open a command prompt (CMD) and type:

pip install pyinstaller

2. Compile the script into an executable

Navigate to the folder where your Python script is located (e.g., script.py) using the cd command, then run:

pyinstaller --onefile script.py

This will generate an .exe file in the dist/ folder.

3. Useful options with PyInstaller

Create an executable without a console (for GUI applications):

pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole script.py

Add an icon to the executable:

pyinstaller --onefile --icon=icon.ico script.py


4. Retrieve the executable

The executable is located in the dist/ folder. You can copy and run it on other machines without needing to install Python.

**_How Install PyInstaller ?_**
1. Download Python

Go to the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Click on Download Python 3.x.x (choose the latest stable version).


2. Start the Installation

Open the python-3.x.x.exe installer you just downloaded.

Check the "Add Python to PATH" box (very important, or Windows wonâ€™t know where to find it).

Click Install Now.


3. Verify the Installation

Once installed, open the command prompt (Win + R â†’ type cmd â†’ Enter) and type:

python --version

or

python3 --version

If it returns a version number (Python 3.x.x), you're good to go!

4. Test in a Terminal

Still in the console, just type:

python

You should see the Python interpreter start (>>>).

**_Pip Not Working ?_**
Pip is usually installed with Python, but if it's missing or broken, hereâ€™s how to (re)install it properly on Windows.


---

1. Check if pip is already installed

Open Command Prompt (Win + R â†’ type cmd â†’ Enter) and run:

pip --version

If you see something like:

pip 23.0.1 from C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3x\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.x)

Then pip is already installed! (If not, keep going ðŸ‘‡)


---

2. Manually install pip

Method 1: Using ensurepip (if Python â‰¥ 3.4)

In Command Prompt, run:

python -m ensurepip --default-pip

Then check with:

pip --version

Method 2: Using get-pip.py (if ensurepip doesnâ€™t work)

1. Download get-pip.py from this official link.


2. Save the file in your Downloads folder (or anywhere youâ€™ll remember).


3. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the folder, e.g.:

cd %USERPROFILE%\Downloads


4. Then run:

python get-pip.py


5. Once done, check with:

pip --version




---

3. Add pip to the PATH variable (if needed)

If pip still doesnâ€™t work, Windows might not know where to find it. Try:

python -m pip --version

If that works, you need to add its path to the PATH variable.

1. Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu.


2. Edit the Path variable and add:

C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3x\Scripts\


3. Restart your terminal and try pip --version again.




---

4. Test pip installation

To check if pip is working properly, install a simple package like requests:

pip install requests

Then test it in Python:

import requests
print(requests.__version__)

If it works, congrats, pip is installed! ðŸŽ‰
